# Queen Attack

#### Check legality of chess Queen attack.

#### By **Erik Killops, Steve Burton**

## Description

This website will allow users to enter (x, y) coordinates for a chess Queen and her target and tell whether the Queen can legally attack that piece.

These are the specs we'll use to write our Queen.CanAttack(x, y) function:

Return true if the target is on the same x-axis as the Queen:
* Input: Queen position is (1, 1) and Target position is (1, 3).
* Output: "true".

Return true if the target is on the same y-axis as the Queen:
* Input: Queen position is (3, 2) and Target position is (1, 2).
* Output: "true".

Return true if the target is located 45 degrees diagonally from the Queen:
* Input: Queen position (1, 1) and Target position (3, 3).
* Output: "true".
* Input: Queen position (4, 1) and Target position (1, 4).
* Output: "true".
